The first thing that we do when creating a software is to read exactly what the requirements specifically are. I write bullet points as to what is the functionalities that is in the requirements. Once we have these bullet points, I then make some form of UML diagram to create the skeleton and functions necessary for these. Using OOP principles we should be able to have a functional and secure programming however, we need to go a step further. After that I double back to look at the code's functionality. Once it does what I think it wants to do we create a test thesis to ensure that it meets the technical requirements that was created for our project.
